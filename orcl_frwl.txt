An Add Ingress Rules dialog is displayed.
Fill in the ingress rule with the following information.

Fill in the ingress rule as follows:

    Stateless: Checked
    Source Type: CIDR
    Source CIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
    IP Protocol: TCP
    Source port range: (leave-blank)
    Destination Port Range: 5000
    Description: Allow HTTP connections



Update firewall settings.

The Ubuntu firewall is disabled by default. However, you need to update your iptables 
configuration to allow HTTP traffic. To update iptables, run the following commands:

sudo iptables -I INPUT 6 -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 5000 -j ACCEPT
sudo netfilter-persistent save

The commands add a rule to allow HTTP traffic through port 5000 and saves the changes to the 
iptables configuration files.
